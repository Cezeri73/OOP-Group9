Introduction
This project is developed as part of CENG201 - Object-Oriented Programming course at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University. The goal of the project is to apply the OOP principles learned throughout the course, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Project Description
The project involves designing and implementing a [type of application or project] that simulates a [describe the purpose of the application, e.g., game, system, simulation]. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java (or whichever language you're using).

Features:
Feature 1: [Brief description]
Feature 2: [Brief description]
Feature 3: [Brief description]
The project demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling, alongside other OOP concepts.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: [Java/Python/C++ or your choice]
IDE: [IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.]
Version Control: Git/GitHub
Installation and Setup
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ceng201-oop-project.git
cd ceng201-oop-project
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Build the project:

In case of Java: Make sure your IDE is configured with JDK 11 or above.
Run the project using the main class in your IDE's run configuration.

Usage
Once the project is running, you can:

Action 1: Describe how to perform the main functionality.
Action 2: Describe any user interaction or input required.
Action 3: Add any specific commands or features that users can utilize.
For example:

bash
Kodu kopyala
java MainClass
Class Structure
Here’s a brief overview of the main classes used in this project:

MainClass: The entry point of the program.
Class1: Manages the functionality for [specific functionality].
Class2: Implements [another feature or module].
Class3: Represents [a model or data structure].
Each class follows key OOP principles like encapsulation, and we’ve applied inheritance in [specific part of your project] to enhance code reusability.
