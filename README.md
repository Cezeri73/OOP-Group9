# 🎯 CENG201 - OOP Project

Welcome to our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project repository, developed as part of the CENG201 course at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University. This project demonstrates key OOP concepts using C++.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we designed and implemented a **Smart Home Automation System**, which applies fundamental OOP principles to manage smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. The system allows users to monitor and control these devices remotely.

### Key Features

- **Device Control:** Users can turn devices on/off and set timers.
- **Monitoring:** Devices send alerts, such as motion detection alerts from security cameras.
- **Observer Pattern:** Devices send notifications when they detect changes (e.g., motion detected).
- **Factory Pattern:** Used to instantiate different types of smart devices dynamically.
- **MVC Pattern:** Separates device logic (Model), control logic (Controller), and the user interface (View) to enhance modularity and maintainability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** [Visual Studio / CLion / Code::Blocks / Vim / etc.]
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
